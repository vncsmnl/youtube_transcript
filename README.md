# Download YouTube Transcript

This simple Python script uses `tkinter` for the GUI, `pytube` for downloading YouTube videos, and `youtube_transcript_api` for fetching video transcripts. The script allows you to download the transcript of a YouTube video in Portuguese and saves it as an HTML file, which can be opened in a web browser for easy reading.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- tkinter
- pytube
- youtube_transcript_api

## Installation
You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install tkinter pytube youtube_transcript_api
```

## Usage
1. Run the script.
2. Enter the link of the YouTube video for which you want to download the transcript.
3. Click the "Download Transcript" button.
4. The transcript will be saved as an HTML file in the same directory as the script and opened in your default web browser.

Feel free to modify and improve the script as needed!
